## Outline

I wanted to create a modern, minimalistic, pest control site. As well as try out different designs.

## Edge Cases I encountered

- Noticed Issue with image links not working correctly in Edge. Discovered the issue was caused by the pathway requiring the `.` in `./images/` path. Chrome will work without the notation.

- When adding `transitions/transforms` to the scocial media icons, it was causing a graphical issue in Chrome with parent containers flickering their color without the inherited `opacity`. Adding the opacity property to the other containers fixed the issue.
